# Build upon Madara

*Uchiwa Madara* <br></br>In this section, we will guide you through the building process so you can start hacking on the Madara stack.
We will go from running your chain locally to changing the consensus algorithm and interacting with smart contracts on your own chain!

## Let's start

<Steps>

### Install dependencies

We first need to make sure you have everything needed to complete this tutorial.

| Dependency  |  Version | Installation |
|---|---|---|
| Rust  | rustc 1.69.0-nightly  | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` <br></br>`rustup toolchain install nightly` |
| nvm  | latest  | `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh \| bash` |
| Cairo  | 1.0  | `curl -L https://github.com/franalgaba/cairo-installer/raw/main/bin/cairo-installer \| bash` |




### Build the chain

We will spin up a CairoVM Rollup from the Madara Stack source code. 
You could use docker images, but this way we keep the option to modify component behavior if you need to do so. 
The Madara stack source code is a monorepo which can be found [here](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/madara)

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:keep-starknet-strange/madara.git
```

Then let's build the chain in `release` mode

```bash
cd madara
cargo build --release
```

**Single-Node Development Chain**

This command will start the single-node development chain with non-persistent
state:

```bash
./target/release/madara --dev
```

Purge the development chain's state:

```bash
./target/release/madara purge-chain --dev
```

Start the development chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/madara -ldebug --dev
```

If everything works correctly, we can go to the next step and create our own genesis state!
