# Madara Layout

**Madara is built by the Starkware Exploration Team a.k.a *[Keep Starknet Strange](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange)* in order to support the 
[fractal scaling vision](https://medium.com/starkware/fractal-scaling-from-l2-to-l3-7fe238ecfb4f) brought up by Starkware years ago.**

There are many reasons why one would want to have their own L3 rather than building directly on Starknet :
- Hyper-scalability
- Better Control
- Privacy
- Cheaper/Simpler interoperability

Madara opens for a whole new field of innovation, application developers can experiment with different data availability solutions, consensus algorithms, proving schemes.

You will find in the `Build On Madara` section details about these different solutions being explored and trade-offs.

## The Madara Stack

For now, let's focus on the high level overview and scrap the surface of each of these layers.

### Execution

The execution layer defines the way blocks are executed and state diffs are produced.
Madara makes it easy to swtich between two different execution crates, [blockifier](https://github.com/starkware-libs/blockifier) by Starkware and [starknet_in_rust](https://github.com/lambdaclass/starknet_in_rust) by LambdaClass.

**Cairo VM**

Under the hood, it will always run the [Cairo VM](https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo-rs) which is being maintained by Starkware and LambdaClass in Rust.
Cairo (CPU Algebraic Intermediate Representation) is a programming language for writing provable programs, where one party can prove to another that a certain computation was executed correctly.
